# Introduction
<p>The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where players control a snake that moves around the game board, eating food items to grow longer. This implementation of the Snake Game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a fun and interactive gaming experience.</p>

# How to play
<p>1: Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the movement of the snake.<br>
2: The snake will continuously move in the direction indicated by the arrow keys.<br>
3: The goal is to eat the food items that appear on the game board, represented by a distinct symbol.<br>
4: As the snake eats the food, it grows longer, making maneuvering more challenging.<br>
5: Be careful not to collide with the walls of the game board or the snake's own body, as it will lead to game over.<br>
6: The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.<br>
7: You can restart the game by refreshing the page.</p>

# Features
<p>1: Responsive and intuitive controls using arrow keys for snake movement.<br>
2: Random generation of food items on the game board for the snake to eat.<br>
3: Collision detection to check for collisions with walls and the snake's own body.<br>

# Technologies used and Sources
