# Introduction
<p>The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where players control a snake that moves around the game board, eating food items to grow longer. This implementation of the Snake Game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a fun and interactive gaming experience.</p>

# How to play
<p>1: Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the movement of the snake.
2: The snake will continuously move in the direction indicated by the arrow keys.
3: The goal is to eat the food items that appear on the game board, represented by a distinct symbol.
4: As the snake eats the food, it grows longer, making maneuvering more challenging.
5: Be careful not to collide with the walls of the game board or the snake's own body, as it will lead to game over.
6: The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.
7: You can restart the game by refreshing the page.</p>
